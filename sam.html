        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            The Automated Monitoring System (SAM) is designed to facilitate the monitoring and management
            of processes, ensuring efficient tracking and control. It is particularly relevant for micro,
            small, and medium-sized enterprises looking to integrate cutting-edge technologies into their
            operations.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            In the context of Industry 4.0, industrial businesses seek to automate processes and monitor
            production stations to enhance efficiency and competitiveness. Given this scenario, simplifying
            industrial process monitoring becomes crucial for technological adaptation, growth, and optimization.

        <p class="about-text">
            To illustrate its application, consider a cookie factory:
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            1. Cookies are placed in the oven for heating. Once they reach a specific temperature for
            a set period, an LED light turns on as an indicator.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            2. The cookies are then removed from the oven by a conveyor belt controlled by a motor
            and pass through an ultrasonic motion sensor for tracking.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            3. A database is populated with real-time information, including oven temperatures,
            LED status, and the number of cookies detected by the sensor.
