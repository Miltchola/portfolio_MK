                A landing page project for the comicbook "The Guardians - Protectors of Mankind", which aims to introduce, in a more engaging way, the project that me and some friends have been working on for years.

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            The landing page was built using React.js, Vite, and TypeScript, with Swiper integration for the image carousel on the page.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            As this page was developed for an existing project of mine, it will definitely be updated and used in the future. I plan to add a section to introduce the characters of the comic as well as a section to showcase the artists involved in the project.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            The page could also be used to promote merchandise and link to delivery services for online purchases.
